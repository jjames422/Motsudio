## Overview

Annoyed that his doctor stating he wasing an ideal candidate that matched his health image , Unseal’s founder Kevin came up with the idea of using the block chain to store individual health images.

Unseal approached us early in their development, having just raised funds through an ICO of their cryptocurrency PlaceboCoin. Having built several block chains int he past we knew that we could help Kevin hit his dreams of having his one web3 project running.

It is always great to partner with clients on their projects and we hope to work with Kevin again on his next project.
