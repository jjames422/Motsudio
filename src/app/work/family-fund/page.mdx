## Overview

Having written one of the most shared posts on medium.com (“_How to maximize family investments_”) FamilyFund approached us looking to build out their own blog.

The blog would help drive new traffic to their site and serve as a resource-hub for users already trying to create a way for their family network to collaborate on family investments. Because it was so important that they own their own content, they decided that using our Infrastructure would be best for them.

We setup a cluster open-shift container platform and used it to hoist up their Nextjs application. The beauty in this approcah was it was going to give them full access and to meet their requirement of 100% scalability.

To optimise their search traffic we used an innovative technique by capilizing on the new app router feautres that are not built into Nextjs. With this new feature we were able to not only speed up their application but maximize their index requests.
