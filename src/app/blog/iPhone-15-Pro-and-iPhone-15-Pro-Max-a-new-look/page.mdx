## EU killed the Lighting Cable.


![](./Apple_iPhone_15_Pro_USB.jpg)
Say goodbye to the Lightning cable—the EU killed it! As of 2024, Apple will no longer be allowed to include their proprietary Lightning charging cable with iPhones sold in Europe. New legislation passed by the European Union requires all mobile devices to adopt the common USB-C standard to reduce electronic waste.

This is excellent news for the environment and your wallet! With the new iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, Apple has finally ditched the Lightning port in favor of USB-C. Now you can use the same charger for your MacBook, iPad, and iPhone—no more tangled cables or buying expensive Apple-only chargers. The days of scrambling to borrow a friend's Lightning cable or shelling out $19 for a new one are over.

The EU's push for a universal charging standard is a win for sustainability. Reducing electronic waste and demand for the production of obsolete charging cables will benefit the planet. Kudos to the European Union for passing this forward-thinking legislation! Apple had no choice but to comply, and we consumers are reaping the rewards.

With faster charging, higher wattage support, and data transfer speeds up to 10Gbps, USB-C is a superior charging method to the old Lightning port. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max also have the best battery life of any iPhone yet, with up to 22 hours of video playback. You can quickly charge your new iPhone up to 50% in just 30 minutes!

The end of the Lightning cable is bittersweet but ultimately for the greater good. While we bid farewell to an era, the new age of USB-C connectivity for iPhones has an exciting future ahead. The possibilities for faster charging, data transfers, and reduced waste are worth celebrating. The EU's legislation pushing Apple to switch may have just saved the planet one iPhone at a time.

## Conclusion

So there you have it, the latest and greatest iPhones that Apple has to offer. With impressive new features like the dynamic island replacing the notch, the upgraded 48MP camera that takes your photos and videos to a whole new level, and the A17 Bionic chip making everything run faster and smoother, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are shaping up to be two of the most advanced iPhones yet.
